# Directions

This time around, you have to write _everything_.

- Your daemon (server) should be named rshd
- Your client should be named rsh

There is no authentication, so do not leave the daemon
running when you are not testing!

Don't forget to "git add" all your *SOURCE* files.
Don't forget to "git commit" as often as needed.
Don't forget to "git push" at the end!

Good luck!
