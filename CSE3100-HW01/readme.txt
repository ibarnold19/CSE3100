We are providing in this handout:

1. a working makefile (fairly barebone, but functional!)
2. a skeleton for the source code of the answer to Q1
2. a skeleton for the source code of the answer to Q2

Please, do *NOT* rename the executables. The automated testing
we will apply does depend on those names.

Good luck!
